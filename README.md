# Android Studio Stopwatch Tutorial
Source code from the Android Development Workshop by David Read. Note, some source code is adapted from Code in Flow's stopwatch tutorial. Their source code can be found at https://codinginflow.com/tutorials/android/chronometer. This is a simple stopwatch with controls to start, stop, and reset it. It also has some basic styles applied to some of the user interface elements.
